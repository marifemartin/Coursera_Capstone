There are 221738 datapoints in the dataset along with 40 dimensions, reporting on how and when these accidents took place with the environmental factors like weather, light, road conditions, date, hour, and so on. \n\nSince we want to predict the level of severity of the car collisions, we will use the dimension SEVERITYCODE as the dependent variable (Y) and consider some of the other variables as the independents ones (X) to get a result. As there are many independents variables, we will need to identify the related dimensions first.\nThe severity of a car collision is our predictor and it can register five levels:\n\n   0- unknown\n   1- prop damage\n   2- injury\n   2b- serious injury\n   3- fatality\n\nSome of the other attributes presented in the dataset and consider as independent variables are: Location, CollisionType, PersonCount, Injuries, Fatalities, IncDate, InattentionInd, Underinfl, Weather, Roadcond, Lightcond, Speeding,...\n\n"
